My name is Yetunde Sola-Adebayo and I am a senior, studying Computer Science at the University of Houston. I enjoy different aspects of programming but my focus is on Web Development.
I graduate in one year so I am looking for a job in Web development. I would prefer jobs in Texas and I am willing to do remote jobs. My hobbies are cooking, reading and coding. I also enjoy travelling.
If you have any advice or want to contact me. You will find my information on my contact me page. Thank you for reading.
